1. Asynchronous JavaScript Tools
Promises and Async/Await: I have used async and await to fetch data from the API asynchronously.
Event Loop: i am making sure the UI remains responsive by not blocking the main thread. fetchRecipes and fetchIngredients functions are asynchro.
2. Fetch and/or Axios for API Interaction
I have  used the fetch() API to get data from the external API (https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=).
The code also includes error handling for missing data (if (response.meals)).
3. Responsive Web Application
 CSS Grid for the recipe container,  works well for responsiveness. 

4. Creative and Fun Ideas
Recipe Search: The app allows users to search for recipes and view detailed information like ingredients and instructions of the project.
Recipe Details Popup: implemented a popup that shows detailed information about a recipe when clicked.
Issues and Suggestions for Improvement.
